# evilportal-htmlsquash
HTML Squasher is an Evil Portal HTML squashing tool for the Flipper Zero WiFi Dev Board. The Evil Portal only allows 20KB single file HTML for the actual portals, and this script is intended to take your output from the “SingleFile” Chrome extension and compress it as much as possible.
